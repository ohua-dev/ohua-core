module Ohua.DAGLang.Lang where

--
-- This module defines the dag lang which is inspired by the dag calculus:
-- "Umut A. Acar, Arthur Chargu√©raud, Mike Rainey, and Filip Sieczkowski. 2016. Dag-calculus: a calculus for parallel computation. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2016)."
-- It contains concepts for spawning and joining tasks.
-- As such it represents the backend IR which contains parallel abstractions.
-- It allows to implement schedulers and realizes Ohua's section concept.
-- We transform the DFLang straight into the DAGLang.
